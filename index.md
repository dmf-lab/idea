The International Design Engineering Annual (IDEA) Challenge is an annual design competition involving labs from the Engineering Design academic community.  It aims to:

1. Apply the finest minds in the engineering design community to address a real-world global design challenge.
2. Facilitate a collaborative and competitive working environment used as a design study to be run by the host institution including shared datasets.
3. Foster community across Engineering Design Research groups.
4. These areas are of particular importance now as it will be two consecutive years without in-person conferences for the community, meaning that many Postgraduate Researchers have not interacted extensively with others in their research field.

### Who will be hosting?

IDEA 2021 will be hosted by the University of Bristol’s [Design and Manufacturing Futures Lab](http://www.dmf-lab.co.uk).  Due to ongoing COVID restrictions, this will be hosted virtually from September 6th to the 9th corresponding to 3.5 days’ designing and making with final design submissions and presentations occurring on the afternoon of the 4th day (9th September from 3.30pm BST).  Participation by individual teams will be aligned with local coronavirus restrictions but is permitted to be virtual, in person or hybrid.

### What’s the prize?

The much-coveted IDEA Cup.  This will be presented virtually or in person after the competition. Acceptance speeches not essential but encouraged.  

What is the benefit for participating research groups?
-	Access to the datasets generated during the competition.
-	Opportunities for collaborative research using the datasets.
-	Stimulate collaboration between research groups.
-	Team building exercise within research groups,
-	Winning team can design and host next year’s competition. But they will also have to coordinate the IDEA annual publication (paper).

### Who can participate?

Anyone is welcome to participate from post-graduate level and up with an interest and/or involvement in the field of engineering design research.  Teams are expected to have 3-4 members.  

### What's in it for participants? 

1. The opportunity to meet other researchers from groups around the world, foster community and create new international research collaboration opportunities.
2. Develop key skills in Rapid Product Development.
3. Compete with design experts across the globe.
4. Have your designs showcased internationally.
5. The option to be a named author on a collaborative research paper presenting the findings of the study.
6. Gain ECTS towards your studies (institution dependent).
